## EXP 4: Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques  
### Lab Scenario: Smart Health Assistant System  

---

## Description

You are part of a development team working on an AI-based Smart Health Assistant named **"MediGuide"**. This assistant is designed to support elderly patients in managing chronic diseases like **diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis**. The primary objective of MediGuide is to deliver:

- Personalized health advice  
- Timely medication reminders  
- Daily well-being tips  
- Friendly emotional support  

MediGuide should understand and respond to natural human language with empathy, clarity, and accuracy. It must adapt to user needs and deliver context-aware, compassionate guidance in all scenarios.

---

## Objective

To develop a **scenario-based report** that demonstrates how various **AI prompting techniques** — including:

- Zero-Shot Prompting  
- Few-Shot Prompting  
- Chain-of-Thought Prompting  
- Role-Based Prompting  
- Multi-Modal Prompting  

— can be used to train and optimize **MediGuide’s** responses for different health-related use cases involving elderly patients.

## Algorithm

1. **Identify Use Cases**  
   Define common interaction scenarios between elderly users and MediGuide (e.g., symptom queries, emotional support, medication tracking).

2. **Choose Prompting Techniques**  
   Select the appropriate prompting method for each use case based on complexity and emotional sensitivity.

3. **Design Prompts**  
   Write effective prompt examples for each selected technique to guide AI responses.

4. **Generate Responses**  
   Use each prompt to test MediGuide’s output.

5. **Evaluate Performance**  
   Review each AI-generated response for accuracy, empathy, tone, and medical relevance.

6. **Refine Prompts**  
   Modify prompts to improve the assistant’s understanding and output quality.

7. **Document Findings**  
   Record how each prompting style affects the system’s conversational performance and relevance to the elderly user base.

## Output

### 1. Zero-Shot Prompting
**Prompt**:  
"List symptoms of high blood sugar."  
**Response**:  
"Common symptoms of high blood sugar include increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, blurred vision, and slow-healing wounds."  
**Use Case**: Quick information queries without prior context.

---

### 2. Few-Shot Prompting  
**Prompt**:  
'I have a headache.' → 'Drink water and rest in a quiet, dark room.'
'My knee hurts.' → 'Apply a warm compress and avoid strain.'
'I feel dizzy in the morning.' → ?
**Response**:  
"Dizziness in the morning may be caused by low blood pressure or dehydration. Try standing up slowly and staying hydrated."  
**Use Case**: Symptom-based self-care suggestions.

---

### 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting  
**Prompt**:  
"A patient forgot to take their blood pressure medicine. Think step-by-step to decide what advice to give."  
**Response**:  
1. Ask how long it's been since the missed dose.  
2. If it's just a few hours, advise to take it.  
3. If close to next dose, skip and resume schedule.  
4. Recommend consulting a doctor.  
**Use Case**: Handling complex medical scenarios safely.

---

### 4. Role-Based Prompting  
**Prompt**:  
"You are a kind and empathetic health assistant. Respond to: 'I feel lonely and tired today.'"  
**Response**:  
"I'm sorry you're feeling this way. You're not alone — I’m here for you. Maybe listening to your favorite music or calling a loved one could help. Would you like a calming activity suggestion?"  
**Use Case**: Emotional support and companionship.

---

### 5. Multi-Modal Prompting  
**Prompt**:  
*(Input: Image of a breakfast plate + Text: "Is this okay for a diabetic?")*  
**Response**:  
"This looks high in carbs due to white bread and fruit juice. Consider switching to whole grains, protein, and unsweetened tea."  
**Use Case**: Interpreting images for nutrition guidance.

---

## Result

By applying **diverse prompting techniques**, MediGuide effectively responds to a wide range of user scenarios. Each method improves different aspects:

- **Zero-shot**: Quick factual responses.  
- **Few-shot**: Accurate and safe symptom responses.  
- **Chain-of-thought**: Logical and multi-step reasoning.  
- **Role-based**: Emotionally intelligent and comforting replies.  
- **Multi-modal**: Capable of analyzing mixed input like images and text.

These prompting strategies enable MediGuide to deliver **reliable, empathetic, and adaptive healthcare support**, especially tailored for elderly users managing chronic conditions.
